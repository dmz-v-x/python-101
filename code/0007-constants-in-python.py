# Python doesn't have built-in way to declare constant like other languages, However the convention for declaring constants is that they are written in uppercase letters.

PI = 3.14159
MAX_USERS = 100
APP_NAME = "My App"

print(PI)
print(MAX_USERS)
print(APP_NAME)

# Although we can re-assign a value to variable PI but not a recommended practice.
