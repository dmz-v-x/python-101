## Introduction to Python

### Overview
Python is a **high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language** created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.  
It emphasizes **readability**, **simplicity**, and **productivity**, making it one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages in the world.

### What is Python?

Python is an **open-source** programming language designed for **code readability** and **rapid development**.  
It supports **multiple programming paradigms** — including:
- **Procedural programming**
- **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**
- **Functional programming**

Python code is known for being close to human language, which allows developers to express ideas with fewer lines of code compared to other languages like Java or C++.

### A Brief History

| Year | Event |
|------|--------|
| **1989** | Guido van Rossum begins developing Python as a hobby project. |
| **1991** | First version (Python 0.9.0) released. |
| **2000** | Python 2.0 introduced — added garbage collection and Unicode support. |
| **2008** | Python 3.0 released — major redesign for better consistency and future-proofing. |
| **Today** | Python 3.x is the dominant version used in education, research, and industry. |

### Advantages of Python

| Advantage | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| **Readable & Simple Syntax** | Code is almost like writing in English. |
| **Large Standard Library** | Comes with extensive built-in modules (e.g., `os`, `datetime`, `json`). |
| **Extensive Ecosystem** | Thousands of external packages for every possible need. |
| **Community Support** | One of the largest programming communities worldwide. |
| **Portability** | Write once, run anywhere. |
| **Productivity Boost** | Faster development cycle than most compiled languages. |
| **Open Source** | Free to use, modify, and distribute. |

### Disadvantages of Python

| Disadvantage | Explanation |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Slower Execution Speed** | Interpreted language → slower than C/C++ or Java for CPU-heavy tasks. |
| **High Memory Usage** | Dynamic typing consumes more memory. |
| **Not Ideal for Mobile Apps** | Rarely used for mobile development. |
| **Runtime Errors** | Dynamically typed → type-related bugs may appear during execution. |
| **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** | Limits true parallel execution in multi-threaded programs. |
